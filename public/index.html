    <meta name="description" content="Dan Lubbers is a Photographer/Retoucher based in Saratoga Springs, NY. A love of the outdoors has led Lubbers to places around the world like performing service work in Guatemala and roaming the pyramids of Ancient Egypt.
    Lubbers got his start with Extreme Sports Photography when he was the sole photographer on the La Sportiva Solutions Climbing Tour in 2007 and began shooting for Extreme Sports Editorials and various outdoor companies.
    He is a freelancer for Amazon's Largest Photo Studio. He recently retouched an ad campaign for Tempurpedic. He is also a contributor to Aurora Photos. Lubbers has really delved into a passion for Environmental & Fine Art Portraiture.
    A love of good coffee usually leads one to find him at local coffee shops working diligently on his work either at home or when traveling. Lubbers recently received his certification badge from DevMountain in Full-Stack Web Development.">

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
